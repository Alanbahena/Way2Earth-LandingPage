# Way2Earth-LandingPage

This was my First iOS Project ðŸ§ª back in 2019.  

Here you may find the code of the Way2Earth Web Landing Page. 
It was a quick landing page with basic HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap Library, basic Back Back-End technology with the implementation of Nodemailer and Mailchimp APIs.
